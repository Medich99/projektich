## What to fix?

## Missing README file
Add (in this case, don't leave it empty) a README file to the project to provide some context and instructions on how to run the app.

## Cannot start the app
Missing `Flask-SQLAlchemy` package in the `requirements` file

## Navigation
Add navigation menu because it is not obvious how to navigate between pages

## Configuration
Since you are using environment variables (i.e. `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`) you should use `python-dotenv` package to load them from `.env` file. This way you can keep your secrets out of the code and you can have different configuration for different environments (e.g. development, production, etc.)

## Error handling
Add error handling, especially around the database calls, to prevent the application from crashing when the database is unavailable or if there is an error with a query.

## Input validation
Validate inputs before using them. For instance, in the `/analyze` route, check if the sequences entered by the user are valid before passing them to `calculate_percentage_similarity` and `count_sequence_characters`.

## Code redundancy
The function `calculate_similarity` is a redundant wrapper for `calculate_percentage_similarity`. Consider removing it unless there's a specific reason for its existence.

## Comments and documentation
Add comments and docstrings to the code to provide more context and make it easier for others (and future you) to understand the code.

## SQLAlchemy?
I don't have anything agains it, on contrary, I like it. But, in this case, it might be an overkill. Consider using a simpler solution, like `sqlite3` to store and query the data.
